# Mahir101-DSnAlgo-Java-GoogleDoc

#Love IDE because IDE will assist you but Google doc won't. hahaha  Apart from Joke practice on text editor and compile your code using command line 

Learning from failures:

- look out for the annotations and internal class files of your language to learn in depth
- convert what you think into code [Do it fast and correct]
- Don't starting writing codes after listening to the questions directly, ask related questions, verify first
- Don't practice problem solving in multiple languages, it may become on reason for mind-block during a session
- Personal blockers -> during a session, you might feel that this is not working and you become reactive instead of being proactive
- have emotional stability during a session, everyone fails at most but get passed in 2-3 ones
- don't feel ashamed for your mistake, try harder [was absent in last session]
